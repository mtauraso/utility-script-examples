# Utility Script Examples

Everyone who works with code ends up writing a few utility scripts to do 
various sorts of cleanup, automate small routine tasks for others, or in
some cases provide a public interface to some ugly functionality.

This is a cross-platform repository showcasing and explaining best practices
for those scripts. The scripts are heavily commented with explanation.

The sample workload that the scripts do is rather trivial, they copy files from
`data/` to `generated/` and change the names of the files. The .gitignore file 
in this repository is set to ignore all the files in `generated/`.
